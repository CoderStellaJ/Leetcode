/*
Complexity:O(log (m+n))

Algorithm:
From the complexity requirement, the clue is to keep partitioning the 2 arrays into half(similar to binary search).

Syntax:
1. length of a vector: myvec.size()
2. average value and sum variables may be double instead of int

Corner case:
1. both are empty arrays
2. one of them is empty
3. the mid index is not an int

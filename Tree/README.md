# Tree

### Basic Types of Trees
1. Binary Search Tree
<br/>Binary Search Tree, is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:
<br/>The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
<br/>The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
<br/>The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
<br/>There must be no duplicate nodes.
<br/>Each node has at most 2 children, but also can have only 0 or 1 child.


### Basic Algorithms
1. Inorder/Preorder/Postorder Traversal
<br/> LCR/CLR/LRC
<br/> Finish the left/right subtree before proceeding to C

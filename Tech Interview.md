# Technical Interview
Here is a summary of my experience in technical interviews.

### How to answer coding questions 

1. Tell the interviewers your understanding of the question

2. Come up with some possible corner cases you think useful for helping thinking

3. Briefly talk about your first method

4. Writing while talking about Variables you need, the functionality of for loops

5. After writing your algorithm, go through your algorithm and explain it. In the meanwhile, check your code

6. Analyze the complexity of the algorithm

7. Run it and Debug (if possible)

8. Find restrictions in your algorithm and come up with the second method 

9. Repeat steps 3 to 7

### Good habits when coding

1. Write some auxiliary comments to help yourself figure out what functionality you want to achieve in this section

2. build large skeletal structure first before going into the details

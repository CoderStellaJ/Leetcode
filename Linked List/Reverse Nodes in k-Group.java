/*
Algorithm:


Syntax:
1. public class
When a class is declared with the public keyword, 
it means this class is accessible and visible to all the classes in all the packages in Java.

2. instantiate a public class
ListNode cur;  

3. Pass Parameters
The statement that "java is always pass-by-value" is technically correct, but it can be very misleading, 
because as you have just witnessed, when you pass an object to a function, the function can modify the contents of the object, 
so it appears that the object has been passed by reference, and not by value. So, what is happening?
Pointers. That's what's happening.
So, the statement "java is always pass-by-value" is true from a strictly technical, 
but ultimately not very useful point of view, according to which objects are never really passed anywhere, 
only pointers to the objects are passed.

4. null in java not NULL

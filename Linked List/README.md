# Linked List

### Corner cases
- empty linkedlist
- one element in the list
- two elements in the list
- more than three elements

<br/> For sorting problems 
- ascending order
- descending order
- random sequence

### Things to note
1. cur->next
Also consider the case that cur is NULL
2. In each iteration, is prev and cur both moved to the next?
